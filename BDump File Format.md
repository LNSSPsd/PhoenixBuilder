# BDump File Format

BDump v3 is a file format for storing Minecraft's structures. It is made of different commands that indicate the constructing process.

By writing the ids that represent each blocks in a specific order is a workable plan that reduces the file size, but this would allow a large amount of unexpected air blocks that increasing the file size so we implemented a new format which has a pointer that indicates where the "brush" is, the file is a set of commands that tells the "brush" how to move, and where to place blocks. Within this file format, air blocks can be simply skipped by a move command so files can be smaller.

## Basic File Structure

BDump v3 file's extension is `.bdx`, and the general header of it is `BD@`, which stands for that the file was compressed with brotli compression algorithm (official compress quality is 6). Note that there's also a header `BDZ` that stands for the file was compressed with gzip compression algorithm, which is no longer supported by FastBuilder Phoenix today since it has been deprecated for a long time and it's hard to find this type's file again. We define such kind of header as "compression header"  and the content after it is compressed with the compression algorithm it indicates.

> Tip: BDump v2's extension is `.bdp` and the header is `BDMPS\0\x02\0`.

The header of the compressed content is `BDX\0`, and the author's player name that terminated with `\0` is followed right after it. Then the content after it is the command with arguments that written one-by-one tightly. Each command id would take 1 byte of space, like what an `unsigned char` do.

All the operations depend a `Vec3` value that represents the current position of the "brush".

Let's see the list of commands first.

> For example, an int32 number in little endian, `1`, is `01 00 00 00` in the memory, and the memory of an int32 number `1` in big endian is `00 00 00 01`.

Type definition:

* {int}: a number that can be positive, negative or zero.
* {unsigned int}: a number that can be positive or zero.
* `char`: an {int} value with 1 byte long.
* `unsigned char`: an {unsigned int} value with 1 byte long.
* `short`: an {int} value with 2 bytes long.
* `unsigned short`: an {unsigned int} value with 2 bytes long.
* `int32_t`: an {int} value with 4 bytes long.
* `uint32_t`: an {unsigned int} value with 4 bytes long.
* `char *`: a string that terminated with `\0` (encoding is utf-8).
* `int`: alias of `int32_t`
* `unsigned int`: alias of `uint32_t`
* `bool`: a value that can be either `true(1)` or `false(0)`, 1 byte long.

The list above is all the commands of the bdump v3 till 2021-8-15.

Let's see how to make a `bdx` file using these commands.

If we want to place a TNT block at `{3,5,6}`(**relative**), and a repeating command block with command `kill @e[type=tnt]` and name `Kill TNT!` that doesn't need redstone to be activated at `{3,6,6}`, then a glass block at `{114514,15,1919810}` and a iron block at `{114514,15,1919800}`, the uncompressed bdx file might be:

`BDX\0DEMO\0\x01tnt\0\x1C\x03\x01repeating_command_block\0\x01glass\0\x01iron_block\0\x1E\x06\x1D\x05\x07\0\0\0\0\x10\x1B\0\x01\0\0\x01kill @e[type=tnt]\0Kill TNT!\0\0\0\0\0\0\x01\x01\0\0\x1D\x09\x19\0\x1D\x4B\x3C\x15\0\x01\xBF\x4F\x07\0\x02\0\0\x1E\xF6\x07\0\x03\0\0XE`

The pseudo assembly code form of this file is:

```assembly

end

## Signing

*FastBuilder Phoenix* 0.3.5 implemented a bdump file signing system in order to identify the file's **real** publisher. Though using the PGP to sign is a good and secure way, we've chosen a signing method that highly depends on our authentication server since it's meaningless to implement the PGP signing just for an online program that can connect to the server anytime.

Note that a signature isn't required for a `bdx` file unless the user sets a `-S`(strict) flag. If you implemented the signing process, you should make sure that it works correctly since a `bdx` file with an incorrect signature won't be able to be processed by *FastBuilder Phoenix*.

### API

First let's learn the APIs of `bdx` file signing. We've implemented two apis to finish the signing process.

The host of these APIs is `uc.fastbuilder.pro` and HTTPS is required.

#### Signing

* Request:

    ```http
    POST /signbdx.web HTTP/1.1
    Host: uc.fastbuilder.pro
    User-Agent: MyApplication/0.1
    
    {"hash": "<The hash of your uncompressed bdx content without the end command 'X'.>","token": "<Your FastBuilder Token>"}
    ```

* Response:

  ```http
  HTTP/1.1 200 OK
  Content-Type: application/json
  
  {"success":true,"sign":"<Base64 of signature>",message:""}
  ```

#### Verifying

* Request:

    ```http
    POST /verifybdx.web HTTP/1.1
    Host: uc.fastbuilder.pro
    User-Agent: MyApplication/0.1
    
    {"hash": "<The hash of your uncompressed bdx content without the end command 'X'.>","sign": "<The signature's base64 value>"}
    ```

* Response:

  ```http
  HTTP/1.1 200 OK
  Content-Type: application/json
  
  {"success":true,"corrupted":false,"username":"The person who signed the file",message:""}
  ```

After requesting the signing api, the base64 value of the signature should be decompressed and written to the compressed part of file, then the signature length and `isSigned` flag.
